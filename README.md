A great README is essential for any project, especially a team-built one. It not only explains the project but also gives credit to the contributors. Here is a professional and comprehensive `README.md` for your EcoTrack project, updated to include your team's name and a link to the live demo.

You can copy and paste this directly into a `README.md` file in the root directory of your project.
